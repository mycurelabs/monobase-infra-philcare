# Upgrade the shared Gateway API CRDs to the bundle pinned by our NGF release.
#
# The gateway.networking.k8s.io CRDs are cluster-scoped and shared; they are
# deliberately NOT managed by any ArgoCD Application (an app-level
# skipCrds/prune cascade can delete them out from under every HTTPRoute in
# the cluster). They carry
# argocd.argoproj.io/sync-options=Prune=false + helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
# and are upgraded only by running this script on purpose.
#
# Keep NGF_REF in lockstep with nginxGateway.version in
# values/clusters/<cluster>/argocd/infrastructure.yaml — NGF pins the Gateway
# API bundle it is
# tested against (v2.6.7 -> Gateway API v1.5.1, experimental channel; the
# experimental channel is required for UDPRoute/TCPRoute on NGF <= 2.6).
#
# --force-conflicts is intentional: field ownership is reclaimed from stale
# managers (removed ArgoCD apps, manual applies).
